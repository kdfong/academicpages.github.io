I am currently a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/kara-fong/) and [Junior Research Fellow](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/fellows/junior-research-fellowships/) in Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, working with Profs. [Clare Grey](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/grey/index) and [Angelos Michaelides](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/). In early 2025, I will join Caltech as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering.

I graduated with my PhD from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, co-advised by Prof. [Kristin Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/) and Prof. [Bryan McCloskey](http://www.mccloskeylab.com/). I also collaborated with Prof. [Kranthi Mandadapu](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kranthi/). My research focused on theory and simulation of transport phenomena in lithium ion battery electrolytes. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I graduated with an MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy from the University of Cambridge in 2017. I received my BS in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University in 2016.
