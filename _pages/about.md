I am a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, co-advised by Prof. [Kristin Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/) and Prof. [Bryan McCloskey](http://www.mccloskeylab.com/). I also collaborate with Prof. [Kranthi Mandadapu](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kranthi/). My research focuses on theory and simulation of transport phenomena in lithium ion battery electrolytes. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I graduated with an M.Phil. in Materials Science and Metallurgy from the University of Cambridge in 2017. I received my B.S.  in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University in 2016. 

I will begin as Junior Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge in Fall 2022, then I will join Caltech as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in early 2025.
